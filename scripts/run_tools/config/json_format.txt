# How to use the JSON format

## tools.json

This file is a list of analysis tools. They are described in the following format:

{ "name" : <name of the tool>,
  "invocation" : <how you actually call it from the command line>,
  "output" : <the option you use to control the ouput file/directory>,
  "extra args": <any extra arguments that need to be passed to the tool>,
  "command_format": <see section "Command Format" below>
}

### Command Format
This field tells the tool how to construct the command line call to the tool.
This is done with a string using pre-defined substitution strings as follows:

$invocation$: the invocation field
$output$: the output option
$output_target$: the actual name of the output file or directory (this will be constructed in the C script)
$extra_args$: extra arguments

So, for example, with the infer call
infer run -o "infer_{config}" --keep-going -- make ${make extra args}$

We would write
$invocation$ $output$ $output_target$ $extra_args$ -- make ${make_extra_args}
