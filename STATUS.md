# Artifact Evaluation

We are applying for the Reusable and Available badges.

## Why Available?

We make this repository publicly available with an open-source license.

## Why Reusable?

Both the run_tools and deduplicate_project tools accept easy-to-understand JSON configuration files for each run. This allows easy customization for anyone trying to reuse our tool to reproduce our results, given how long it takes to run experiments. We document in detail how to use the tool and provide prefabricated sample runs.

The samples are directly substitutable with samples obtained with other approaches, allowing for reuse of these artifacts for evaluation of alternative sampling approaches.
