# Description

This repository provides the implementation of the final three steps of the automated framework presented in our FSE'2019 paper (included as ./PDF). The first step, Sample Generation, relies on yet-unpublished research, so we do not include it here. Instead, we provide the results of that step in ./cases, and provide the rest of the framework,  which runs off-the-shelf bug detectors, deduplicates their results, automatically extracts relevant features, and outputs those results in a unified format.

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for instructions on running the experiments.
