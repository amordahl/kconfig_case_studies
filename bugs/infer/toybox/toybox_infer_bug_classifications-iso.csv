To save size, toybox usually relies on this behavior. If you�re running toybox under a debugger or without a real OS (ala newlib+libgloss), enable this to make toybox clean up after itself.� If TOYBOX FREE is not enabled (and by default, it isn�t), the memory allocated by xmprintf will not be freed explictly, and instead will be left open until the program terminates so the operating system can clean it up. This makes classifying this bug tricky. This is obviously a memory leak in the default case, as memory that is being allocated is not being freed; however, it seems that this is an intentional choice by the programmers. For now, this seems to fall nicely under the technically true class, but this could warrant a discussion on how exactly we�re classifying what a bug is.","CONFIG_MOUNTPOINT, -CONFIG_TOYBOX_FREE"
