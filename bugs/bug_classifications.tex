    True & A bug which exists and 1) its existence is unintended, or 2) whether or not its existence is purposeful is undetermined. \\
    \midrule
    Technically True & A bug for which the content of the bug report is true, but whose existence is intended. The difference between a False and Technically True bug report is that the former could theoretically be detected by a more sophisticated implementation of the tool. Often, these bugs are ``true but uninteresting.''\\
    \midrule
    False & A bug the checker finds which, upon further inspection, does not exist in the code. For example, the checker indicating a variable is passed to a function without being initialized, when the variable is actually an out parameter and intialized within the function.\\
