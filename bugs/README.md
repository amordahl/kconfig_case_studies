# Variability-Aware Bug-Finding by Randomly Sampling

This directory house the results of running off-the-shelf bug-finders
on samples of configurations.  Each directory contains aggregation
scripts for each tool as well as the bug reports, source code
snippets, and configurations.

Additionally, `tools/` is a document describing choices of off-the-shelf tools, and `feature_finder/` contains work on localizing
configurations.
