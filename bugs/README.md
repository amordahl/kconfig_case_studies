# Variability-Aware Bug-Finding by Randomly Sampling

This directory house the results of running off-the-shelf bug-finders
on samples of configurations.  Each directory contains aggregation
scripts for each tool as well as the bug reports, source code
snippets, and configurations.

Additionally, `build/` contains bugs resulting from merely building
the configuration.  `feature_finder/` contains work on localizing
configurations.
