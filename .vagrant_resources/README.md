# Setup

The vast majority of the setup was performed automatically when the VM was setup. However, you do need to manually setup the correct version of python.

Run the following commands to install python 3.7.0 and set it as the global default:

`pyenv install 3.7.0`
`pyenv global 3.7.0`

You should now be ready to run the analysis tools. See the README.md in /vagrant/scripts/run_tools to learn how to do this.
